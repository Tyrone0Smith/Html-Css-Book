<h2 id="Directory Structure">Directory Structure</h2>
<p>On large websites, it's common to have a complex directory structure to organize your files. This helps keep your project manageable and makes it easier to find specific files. Here's an example of a more complex directory structure:</p>
<pre>
/my-website
  /index.html
  /about.html
  /contact.html
  /css
    /styles.css
  /js
    /scripts.js
  /images
    /logo.png
    /banner.jpg
</pre>
<p>In this structure, we have a main directory called "my-website" that contains HTML files, as well as subdirectories for CSS, JavaScript, and images.</p>     
<h2 id="Structure">Structure</h2>
<p>The top level folder is known as the root directory, and it contains all the other files and folders for your website.</p>
<p>Each subdirectory typically contains related files. For example, the "css" folder contains all the CSS files, the "js" folder contains all the JavaScript files, and the "images" folder contains all the image files.</p>
<h2 id="Relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>The relationships between files and folders on a website<br>
is described by using the same terminology as a family tree. The root directory is like the trunk of the tree, and each subdirectory is like a branch that contains related files.</p>
<h2 id="Homepages">Homepages</h2>
<p>Every website has a homepage, which is the main page that users see when they visit the site. The homepage is usually located in the root directory and is often named "index.html".<br>
The homepage of a site written in HTML (and the homepages of each<br>
section in a child folder) is called "index.html".</p>
